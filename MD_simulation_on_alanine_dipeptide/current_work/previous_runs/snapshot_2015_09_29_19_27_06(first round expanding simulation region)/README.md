first round of expanding simulation region.

pick 15 points as potential centers and do biased simulation, and then retrain the network.

15 points are [["-0.3", "-0.5"], ["-0.3", "-0.4"], ["-0.3", "-0.3"], ["-0.2", "-0.5"], ["-0.2", "-0.4"], ["-0.2", "-0.3"], ["-0.6", "-0.2"], ["-0.5", "-0.2"], ["-0.4", "-0.2"], ["-0.3", "-0.2"], ["-0.2", "-0.2"], ["-0.1", "-0.2"], ["0", "-0.2"], ["0.1", "-0.2"], ["0.2", "-0.2"]]
